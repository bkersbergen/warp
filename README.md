## Warp

This library contains functions that elongate, compress, scale, time-warp,
and add noise to some original function.  They are called `elongate`, `compress`,
`scale`, `add_noise` and `warp`.

See the [demo notebook](https://github.com/n-s-f/warp/blob/master/demo.ipynb)
for details on how these functions work and examples of their use.

#### Installation

`pip install fwarp`
